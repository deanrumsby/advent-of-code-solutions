# advent-of-code-solutions
A collection of my solutions to the Advent of Code series. 
I am using these challenges to try and implement deliberately general/modular OOP code. 
Since each puzzle contains two parts, I thought it might be fun to design each solution as abstract or as least coupled as I can, to try and minimise any refactoring that is neccessary for the second part of each level. 

It's also a good chance for me to practice unit testing in Python.
