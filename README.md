# advent-of-code-solutions
A collection of my solutions to the Advent of Code series. 
I am using these challenges to try and implement deliberately general/modular OOP code. 
Since each puzzle contains two parts, I thought it might be fun to design each solution as abstract or as least coupled as I can, to try and minimise any refactoring that is neccessary for the second part of each level. 

It's also a good chance for me to practice unit testing and file structuring in Python, since each puzzle has several examples to test with.

To run any of the tests I've made, please run 'python3 -m unittest tests.test_name_here' with the respective challenge as the current directory.
